# Muse Core Modules: Synthesis & Composition Tools in Common Lisp

This file contains core modules for sound synthesis and composition within the **Muse** project. The primary components include oscillators, envelopes generators (EGs), filters, effects processors such as delay lines or reverb units,
and basic utilities that facilitate algorithmic music creation.
To ensure flexibility while maintaining modularity throughout Muse's architecture these fundamental building blocks are designed to be easily integrated with each other and extended upon by users for custom implementations tailored
their unique musical vision. Below we outline definitions, examples of usage along detailed explanations on key parameters affecting their behavior as well how they interact within a larger system.
Lastly some utilities used across multiple components which help simplify development cycles while adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles are also included here before closing off with an overview
on potential future enhancements that could further enhance Muse's capabilities in real-time sound generation and composition scenarios.
