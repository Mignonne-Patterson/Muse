The above code snippet is a Lisp package definition for the Muse project which outlines various sound generation and manipulation utilities provided by this Common Lisp library including basic operations to create ,play mix audio signals through defined interfaces making it easy-to-use in compositions.
Note: This represents simplified structure intended as illustration only actual implementation would be more complex incorporating advanced DSP techniques along with supporting abstractions. }
