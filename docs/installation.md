# Installation Guide for Muse: A High-Performance Music Synthesis System

## Prerequisites
Before you begin installing Muse on your system,
 please ensure that both a Common Lisp implementation and an audio library are installed. We recommend using the Steel Bank CL (SBCL) compiler due to its optimal performance characteristics.
The following dependencies must also be present:
 - Quicklisp: A popular package manager for common lisp
 	- Portaudio or OpenAL libraries : These handle sound output in Muse's environment.
