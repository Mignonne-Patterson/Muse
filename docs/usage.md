# Muse Usage Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a detailed overview of how to utilize various features provided by Muse to create music synthesis applications. It is aimed at developers and musicians interested in creating custom sound synthesis tools.

## Basic Synthesis Modules

### Oscillators
At its core, Muse provides the oscillator module as one of the simplest and most fundamental tools for generating periodic sounds. Here’s how to create a basic sine wave oscillator:

```lisp
;; Load Muse library
(ql:quickload "muse")

;; Create a simple 256Hz Sine Wave Oscillator
(let ((osc1 (make-osc :frequency 256)))
  (play osc1))  ; Start the oscillator to generate an audio signal.
```

The code above creates an instance of a sine wave with a frequency set at 256Hz. You can change frequencies by varying the parameter passed during creation.

### Envelopes
Another key component for controlling how synthesized sounds evolve over time is envelopes that shape volume and other parameters through attack, decay, sustain, and release phases. Here’s a basic example of using an ADSR envelope to modulate our previously created oscillator:

```lisp
;; Load Muse
(ql:quickload "muse")

;; Define the Oscillator as earlier
(let ((osc1 (make-osc :frequency 256)))
  (let ((env (adsr-envelope :attack-time 0.3 :decay-duration 0.4 :sustain-level 0.7 :release-delay 0.5)))
    (modulate osc1 env)  ; Apply envelope to oscillator
    (play-with-env osc1 env)))
```

The ADSR values can be customized according to the desired musical dynamics.

### Filters
Filter modules are essential for shaping sound by emphasizing or attenuating specific frequencies. For instance, using a low-pass filter might remove high-frequency components giving a warmer sound:

```lisp
;; Load Muse
(ql:quickload "muse")

;; Create Oscillator as earlier
(let ((osc1 (make-osc :frequency 256)))
  (let ((filter (lp-filter :cutoff-freq 0.3)))
    (modulate osc1 filter)  ; Apply low-pass filter to oscillator
    (play-with-env osc1 filter)))
```

Filters can be set with different cutoff frequencies depending upon your sonic needs.

The above snippets are just introductory examples showcasing core elements in Muse; more sophisticated techniques and features such as effects processing, polyphony support, and multi-channel synthesis will also enhance the sound production capabilities. For comprehensive understanding on these aspects refer to further sections or documentation provided within the project repository.

## Advanced Usage

### Real-Time Interaction
Muse supports real-time manipulation of parameters including frequencies, dynamics, filter settings, etc., making it suitable for performance scenarios where live adjustments are necessary:

```lisp
;; Load Muse and set up your initial setup as discussed above.
;; Assuming there is some active stream 'my-stream' running with our osc+envelope applied,
(setf (frequency my-osc) 504)  ; Adjust frequency instantly
```

This flexibility allows for dynamic compositions that adapt to live inputs or other external triggers.

### Custom Modules
Muse is highly extensible allowing users to define their own synthesis modules based on specific needs. For example, suppose we want an FM Synthesis module which modulates the carrier frequency using another oscillator:

```lisp
(defclass fm-synthesizer (synthesis-base)
  ((modulation-oscillator :initarg :modulation-oscillator :accessor modulation-oscillator)
   (ratio :initarg :ratio :accessor ratio)
   (amplitude :initarg :amplitude :accessor amplitude)))
```

The implementation details involve overriding synthesis methods to incorporate frequency-modulated output using given oscillators. Detailed code examples can be found in Muse's `examples/custom-modules` directory.

## Documentation
For more detailed tutorials on specific features, advanced usage, or guides related to development and contributing towards improving Muse functionality, you may refer to the comprehensive documentation provided within the 'doc' directory or access it online through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mignonne-Patterson/Muse).

## Summary
Muse provides an extensive toolkit for musicians, composers, and audio programmers enabling the creation of rich sonic experiences whether it be real-time performances, generative algorithmic music compositions, or developing custom synthesis algorithms tailored to specific soundscapes. With its modular architecture allowing integration with existing projects as well as standalone applications, Muse is a powerful tool for creative audio endeavors.
