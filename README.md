# 🎶 Muse: A High-Performance Music Synthesis System

## Overview

Muse is a powerful and flexible music synthesis and composition system built with Common Lisp. Designed for real-time sound generation and algorithmic music creation, Muse offers musicians, composers, and audio programmers a comprehensive toolkit.

## Key Features

- **⚡ Real-Time Sound Generation**: Muse supports live audio processing, making it ideal for performances and interactive installations.
- **🎼 Algorithmic Composition Tools**: With built-in support for generative algorithms, users can automate the composition process and create intricate musical structures dynamically.
- **🎛️ Flexible Synthesis Modules**: A wide range of synthesis techniques are available, allowing for both traditional and cutting-edge sound design.
- **🔌 Modular Architecture**: Muse is designed to be highly extensible, enabling users to integrate their own custom modules and effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Muse requires a Common Lisp implementation. While it has been tested with several compilers, SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is recommended for optimal performance. Additionally, you'll need an audio library such as PortAudio or OpenAL.

### Installation

1. Clone the Muse repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mignonne-Patterson/Muse.git
   cd Muse
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies. You can use a Common Lisp package manager like Quicklisp to manage them.
3. Compile and load the Muse system:
   ```lisp
   (ql:quickload "muse")
   ```
   
## Basic Usage

To create a simple sine wave oscillator and play it, you can write the following Common Lisp code:

```lisp
;; Load Muse
(ql:quickload "muse")

;; Define an oscillator with a frequency of 440 Hz (A4) and amplitude of 0.5
(let ((osc (make-oscillator :frequency 440 :amplitude 0.5)))
  ;; Start the oscillator and play it for 2 seconds
  (with-sound ((duration 2))
    (play osc)))
```
