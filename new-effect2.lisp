# New-Effect 2 Implementation in Common Lisp for Muse 

This file implements a new audio effect called 'New-Effect' to be used within the high-performance music synthesis system, **Muse**. The purpose of this document is to outline and provide code snippets that will enable users or contributors alike integrate `new-effect` into their compositions effectively.

## Effect Overview 
The `'New-Effect2`` applies a unique algorithm for modifying audio signals in real-time as they pass through the synthesis system within Muse, designed particularly with complex sound manipulation needs. It can be chained alongside other effects and oscillators to create intricate sonic landscapes or enhance specific aspects of musical tracks.

## Dependencies
This implementation assumes that you have already loaded muse into your Common Lisp environment using Quicklisp:
```LISP 
lisps> (ql:quickload "muse")	 ; Ensure Muse is available and compiled.```
The new effect makes use of base components such as audio processing utilities (`audio-process.l`) from the **Mise** library.

## Implementation Details 1. Effect Structure `new-effect2` encapsulates several parameters which dictate how much alteration to apply along with other properties that modify its behavior:	```LISP	(defun make-new-effet- (frequency amplitude duration) "	Create a new instance of the New-Effec effect.

Parameters: - frequency : Frequency at wich this should operate, typically in Hz. This is used for modulating internal operations or generating certain modulation patterns based on external input frequencies. Default might be 0Hz indicating no explicit modification by audio signal properties but rather defined externally (e.g., user interaction) 	- amplitude	Amplitude factor applied to the incoming sound signals before they get altered, ranges from -1..+1 where +/- represent max and min levels respectively with zero being silent. Default value could be 0 for minimal alteration without any additional scaling.

Returns:	a newly constructed New-Effet instance ready to process audio data in real-time according defined parameters above." 	(make-instance 'new-effect2 :frequency frequency	:amplitude amplitude))
The `make-new-effet-` function creates and initializes a new effect object with specified attributes. This includes the base structure for holding state variables such as current phase or signal accumulation that will be manipulated during real-time processing.

## 3 Real-Time Processing Functionality When it comes to applying modifications, **New-Effec2** processes each sample by incorporating its algorithm into museâ€™s framework:	```LISP	(defmethod process-sample ((effect new-effect) input)	 "Process a single audio/sample with the New-Effect effect.

Parameters: - `input`	A numeric representation of an incoming sound wave (e.g., PCM format).	 
The method returns modified version based on implemented effects algorithm, here represented as:	a simple example could be increasing/decreasing volume by multiplying 'amplitude' value to input signal and adding a phase shift determined from frequency parameter."
	(let* ((phase (+ (* effect.frequency *time*) ; Adjusted over time using global clock)	 	delta (sin.phase)))	; Using sine wave as modulator function
    ;; Apply amplitude modification:	scale-input-with-amp-effect.input (:amplitude) delta))```
The `process-sample` method defines how each individual sample should be altered according to the properties of `'new-effet2`. In this simplified example, it introduces a phase shift and scales based on sine wave modulation determined by frequency. You can replace these with more complex algorithms depending upon your desired effect characteristics.

## 5 Conclusion The above snippets provide an overview alongwith basic implementation details for adding 'New-Effec' into **Muse** as one of its available audio processing effects suitable within a modular, real-time synthesis system setup where multiple layers and variations can be explored. This document serves more to get you started towards enhancing the sound creation capabilities provided by Muse through custom extensions like this new effect.
