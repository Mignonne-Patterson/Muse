;; New-Effect 2 Implementation in Common Lisp for Muse

;; This file implements a new audio effect called 'New-Effect' to be used within the high-performance music synthesis system, **Muse**.
;; The purpose of this document is to outline and provide code snippets for the implementation.

;; Effect Overview
;; The 'New-Effect2' applies a unique algorithm for modifying audio signals in real-time as they pass through the synthesis system within Muse,
;; designed particularly with complex sound manipulation in mind.

;; Dependencies
;; This implementation assumes that you have already loaded Muse into your Common Lisp environment using Quicklisp:
;; ```lisp
;; (ql:quickload "muse")  ; Ensure Muse is available and compiled.
;; ```
;; The new effect makes use of base components such as audio processing utilities (`audio-process.l`) from the **Muse** library.

(defpackage :muse.new-effect2
  (:use :cl)
  (:export #:make-new-effect2
           #:set-frequency
           #:set-amplitude
           #:process-sample))

(in-package :muse.new-effect2)

;; Effect Structure
;; `new-effect2` encapsulates several parameters which dictate how much alteration to apply along with other properties that modify its behavior.

(defclass new-effect2 ()
  ((frequency :accessor frequency :initarg :frequency :initform 440)
   (amplitude :accessor amplitude :initarg :amplitude :initform 1.0)
   (phase :accessor phase :initform 0.0)))

(defun make-new-effect2 (&key (frequency 440) (amplitude 1.0))
  "Create a new effect object with specified attributes.
   This includes the base structure for holding state variables such as current phase or signal amplitude."
  (make-instance 'new-effect2 :frequency frequency :amplitude amplitude))

(defun set-frequency (effect frequency)
  "Set the frequency for the effect."
  (setf (frequency effect) frequency))

(defun set-amplitude (effect amplitude)
  "Set the amplitude for the effect."
  (setf (amplitude effect) amplitude))

(defmethod process-sample ((effect new-effect2) input)
  "Process the input signal to apply the effect.
   This method returns a modified version based on the implemented effect algorithm."
  (let* ((phase (+ (* (frequency effect) *time*) (phase effect)))
         (delta (sin phase)))
    ;; Apply amplitude modification
    (* input (* (amplitude effect) delta))))

;; Example usage:
(let ((effect (make-new-effect2 :frequency 880 :amplitude 0.5)))
  (set-frequency effect 440)
  (set-amplitude effect 0.8)
  ;; Process sound (input-signal should be defined)
  ;; (process-sample effect input-signal)
  )

;; Conclusion
;; The above snippets provide an overview along with basic implementation details for adding 'New-Effect2' into **Muse** as one of its available audio processing effects suitable within high-performance music synthesis systems.
