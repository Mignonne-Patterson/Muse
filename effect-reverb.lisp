;; **Reverb Effect Module for Muse Sound Synthesis System**
;;
;; This module provides advanced reverb functionality designed to be integrated
;; into real-time audio processing within our high-performance synthesis and
;; composition platform, *Muse*. The `REVERB-EFFECT` class implements the core
;; reverb effect with customizable parameters.

;; **Key Features:**
;; The reverb feature can be customized with the following parameters:
;; - **Reverb Time**: The duration of the reverb tail in seconds, allowing precise control
;;   over the decay of the reverb effect.
;; - **Damping**: A value between `0` (no damping) and `1.0`, indicating how much the
;;   high frequencies are reduced in the reverb tail, shaping its tone.
;; - **Mix**: Control slider that ranges from `0%` (only original sound) up to `100%`
;;   (pure reverb), enabling creative blending of dry versus wet signals.
