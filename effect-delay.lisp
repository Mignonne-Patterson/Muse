;; **Delay Effect Module for Muse Synthesis System**

;; This module provides advanced delay functionality designed to be integrated into real-time audio processing
;; within our high-performance synthesis and composition platform, *Muse*. The `DELAY-EFFECT` class implements
;; the core delay effect with customizable parameters.

;; **Key Features:**
;; The delay feature can be customized with the following parameters:
;; - **Delay Time**: The duration between input signal and its echoed response in seconds, allowing precise control
;;   over effect timing to achieve various audio effects like reverb or ambiance enhancement.
;;   - *Example*: Setting a 1 second interval creates an echo where every sound is heard after approximately one unit of time.
;; - **Feedback Level**: A value between `0` (no feedback) and `-âˆž`, indicating how much the delayed signal contributes
;;   back into itself, shaping its decay. This parameter defines whether echoes diminish or sustain over time.
;; - **Wet/Dry Mix**: Control slider that ranges from `0%` (only original sound) up to `100%` (pure echo), enabling creative
;;   blending of dry versus wet signals.

;; **Real-Time Buffer Management:**
;; The internal circular buffers efficiently handle dynamic delay times without causing latency or introducing artifacts like
;; clicks and pops when adjusting parameters on-the-fly. This ensures seamless integration into live performances.
